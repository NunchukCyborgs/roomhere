          <h4>1. So, what is Roomhere?</h4>
          <p>
            Roomhere is a platform for renters and landlords to come together. We created Roomhere after struggling through the process
            of finding our first apartments. We wanted to make the process easy for everyone to list, find and rent the perfect
            space.
          </p>
          <h4>2. I only see listings for Cape Girardeau, MO. How do I see properties in other cities?</h4>
          <p>Roomhere is local to the Cape Girardeau area, and we are devoted to bringing the best experience to our home first
            before we expand. If you think we would be perfect for your town, give us a shoutout <a href="https://twitter.com/roomhere">on Twitter</a>            or <a href="">on Facebook</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>3. How can I rent a property on Roomhere?</h4>
          <p>Once you find a space you love, you can send an email to the landlord listed on the property page and begin the
            rental process with them directly. We are actively working on a way to simplify this process at Roomhere, so
            keep a lookout for updates!</p>
