        <h4>So, what is Roomhere?</h4>
        <p>
          Roomhere is a platform for renters and landlords to come together. We created Roomhere after struggling through the process
          of finding our first apartments. We wanted to make the process easy for everyone to list, find and rent the perfect
          space.
